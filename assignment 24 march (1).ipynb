    "Q1. **Key Features of the Wine Quality Data Set:**\n",
    "   - **Fixed acidity:** Influences the taste and acidity level.\n",
    "   - **Volatile acidity:** High levels can lead to an unpleasant, vinegary taste.\n",
    "   - **Citric acid:** Adds freshness and flavor to the wine.\n",
    "   - **Residual sugar:** Affects sweetness; balance is crucial.\n",
    "   - **Chlorides:** High levels can taste salty and affect bitterness.\n",
    "   - **Free sulfur dioxide and total sulfur dioxide:** Play a role in preserving the wine and preventing spoilage.\n",
    "   - **Density:** Related to the alcohol content and sweetness.\n",
    "   - **pH:** Influences taste and stability.\n",
    "   - **Sulphates:** Contribute to wine preservation and flavor.\n",
    "   - **Alcohol:** Higher alcohol content can affect the taste and body of the wine.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Importance varies; for instance, acidity levels impact taste balance, sulfur dioxide influences preservation, and alcohol affects the overall feel and taste.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. **Handling Missing Data in Wine Quality Data Set:**\n",
    "   - **Imputation Techniques:**\n",
    "     - **Mean/Median Imputation:** Filling missing values with the mean or median of the feature. Simple but may distort data distribution.\n",
    "     - **Forward/Backward Fill:** Carrying the last/next known value forward/backward. Suitable for time-series data.\n",
    "     - **Interpolation:** Estimating missing values based on other observations. Preserves trends but may introduce bias.\n",
    "     - **Model-Based Imputation:** Predicting missing values using a model. Accurate but computationally expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Advantages:** Preserves data structure, allows for analysis. **Disadvantages:** May introduce bias, impact statistical properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. **Factors Affecting Students' Performance:**\n",
    "   - **Key Factors:**\n",
    "     - **Study Time:** More time invested often correlates with better performance.\n",
    "     - **Attendance:** Regular attendance may positively impact understanding.\n",
    "     - **Parental Involvement:** Supportive parents can influence study habits.\n",
    "     - **Prior Academic Performance:** Past performance is often indicative.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   **Statistical Analysis:**\n",
    "     - **Correlation Analysis:** Explore relationships between variables.\n",
    "     - **Regression Analysis:** Identify factors with the most significant impact.\n",
    "     - **ANOVA/T-Tests:** Compare means across different groups (e.g., high vs. low performers).\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. **Feature Engineering in Student Performance Data Set:**\n",
    "   - **Process:**\n",
    "     - **Creation of New Variables:** Combining existing variables (e.g., total study hours).\n",
    "     - **Binning or Categorization:** Grouping continuous variables (e.g., age groups).\n",
    "     - **Normalization or Standardization:** Scaling variables to a common range.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Variable Selection:**\n",
    "     - **Correlation Analysis:** Identify relationships between variables.\n",
    "     - **Feature Importance from Models:** Use models to assess variable importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Wine Quality Data Set:**\n",
    "   - **Distribution Analysis:**\n",
    "     - Use histograms or kernel density plots to visualize feature distributions.\n",
    "     - Features like volatile acidity or residual sugar may exhibit non-normality.\n",
    "   - **Transformation Suggestions:**\n",
    "     - **Log Transformation:** For positively skewed data.\n",
    "     - **Box-Cox Transformation:** For handling different types of skewness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on Wine Quality Data Set:**\n",
    "   - **Perform PCA:**\n",
    "     - Standardize the data.\n",
    "     - Calculate covariance matrix.\n",
    "     - Compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors.\n",
    "     - Select principal components based on explained variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Minimum Principal Components for 90% Variance:**\n",
    "     - Identify the cumulative explained variance.\n",
    "     - Determine the number of components needed for 90% explained variance."
